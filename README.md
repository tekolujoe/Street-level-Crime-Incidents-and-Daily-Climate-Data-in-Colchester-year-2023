# Street-level-Crime-Incidents-and-Daily-Climate-Data-in-Colchester-year-2023

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation**

**Background**
The coursework involves an individual analysis of two datasets: crime23.csv and temp2023.csv. These datasets relate to street-level crime incidents and daily climate data in Colchester in 2023. The crime data has been extracted using an interface that provides detailed descriptions of the variables, accessible at https://ukpolice.njtierney.com/reference/ukp_crime.html. Similarly, the climate data was collected from a weather station near Colchester, with variable descriptions and extractions interface available at https://bczernecki.github.io/climate/reference/meteo_ogimet.html.

This project is submitted at the University of Essex as part of the MA304 **Data Visualisation** Module

**Task and Aim:**
The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the datasets, aiming to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the crime and climate data and gain insights into factors influencing the occurrences and potential relationships within the datasets.

**Methodology**
The analysis will include descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis to uncover patterns and relations within the datasets. Advanced graphics and interactive plots will be utilized to enhance the presentation of the findings. The project will be carried out using R Markdown, providing a detailed interpretation of the results.
